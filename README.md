# Gato GraphQL - Extensions Planning and Tracking

This repo is for collecting user feedback concerning [Gato GraphQL](https://gatographql.com)'s commercial extensions:

- Issues
- Requests for new extensions

Concerning the free Gato GraphQL plugin, please use the [`GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL`](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/GatoGraphQL) repo instead.

## Issues

Please report any issue in the [Issues board](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/ExtensionsPlanningAndTracking/issues).

## Request for extensions

Weâ€™re using the [Discussions board](https://github.com/GatoGraphQL/ExtensionsPlanningAndTracking/discussions) to receive suggestions on what commercial extensions we should implement next.

If you need a new extension, please:

- First check if it has already been submitted by someone else, and if so:
  - Upvote it
  - Indicate if there's any additional requirement you need
- Otherwise submit a new entry, with a description of the needed requirements

For instance, you can suggest an integration with some 3rd-party plugin, stating what data you need to retrieve from it (everything? just a handful of fields? are mutations needed?)

<!-- The Gato GraphQL team will prioritize new extensions on the number of upvotes for each request. -->
